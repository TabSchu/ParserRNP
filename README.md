# ParserRNP
Parses infix expression to Reverse Polish notation (RPN) using Java CC


Small project for international week at Hochschule Bremen 
Presentation: ParserRNP/FirstTest_RNP/RPN_Parser.pdf


Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which expressions are given in postfix notation, 
that is, every operator follows all of its operands. For example, using RPN we write
3 4 +
to denote the sum of 3 and 4, instead of 3 + 4.
Expressions in RPN are evaluated left-to-right
. The infix expression 5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) â€“ 3 yields the following RPN expression
5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -
